# [ðŸ¤–] Simpletron ML

The Simpletron is a computer that runs programs in its native language: Simpletron Machine Language (SML). It has an accumulator for storing information used in calculations and a 100-word memory. 

Each word is a signed four-digit decimal number. SML programs are loaded into memory starting at location 00 and each instruction occupies one word. Instructions have a plus sign, while data words can have either plus or minus signs. 

The first two digits of an instruction are the operation code and the last two digits are the operand, which is the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies.
